# eris services edit

Edit a service.

## Synopsis

Edit a service definition file which is kept in ~/.eris/services.
Edit will utilize your default editor. (See also the ERIS environment variable.)

How that service is used for a specific project is handled from project
definition files.

eris services edit NAME
```
